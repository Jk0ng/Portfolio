About Me
I am a software developer with a strong passion for continuous learning and growth. My journey into the tech industry is somewhat unconventional, as it began after I pursued a career as a Physical Therapy Student at UCSF. While my academic background in Physical Therapy equipped me with invaluable skills such as discipline and stress management, it also instilled in me a profound desire to remain a lifelong learner.
